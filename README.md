pi-low-pass
===========

This is a basic PCB based on the work by @CurlyMoo (https://github.com/CurlyMoo/433.92-Raspberry-Pi) to control a 433.92mhz sender/receiver with your raspberry pi.

The PCB is based on the schema by CurlyMoo, and is released under the GPLv3.

Testing
===========
The PCB, as is in the repo, has currently not tested, and can contain mistakes. Iam currently waiting for a first batch of test PCBs to make sure everything is working fine.


PCB
===========
The PCB is created with Eagle, and uses primarly SMD components to reduce the size of the PCB. As far I can see, the source eagle files are XML. If you want to contribute a patch to these PCBs, please create a pull request for your changes.
